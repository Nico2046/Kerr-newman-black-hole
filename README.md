# Calculation of curvatures invariants for Kerr-Newman spacetime

The coordinate system used is of Boyer-Lindquist : (t,r,theta,phi). The following change of variable is made to reduce calculation time: y=cos(theta).  
The convention used for the metric signature is (+,-,-,-).  

The calculation is performed on matematica 13.0, with:  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5625U  
GPU: AMD ATI Barcelo
