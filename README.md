# Calculation of curvature invariants for Kerr-Newman spacetime

The goal is to calculate the curvature invariants associate to the Kerr-Newman metric.
To do this we use the standard tensor calculus of general relativity. We verify also that Kerr-Newman metric is a solution of Einstein equation in presence of electromagnetic field. Finally we plot the Kretschmann scalar as depending of the two parameters $Q$ the electric charge of the black hole, and $a$ the spin parameter of the black hole.

The metric is written in Boyer-Lindquist coordinate system: $(t,r,\theta,\phi)$.
The following change of variable could be used to reduce calculation time: $y=\cos(\theta)$.
The metric signature used is $(+ - - -)$.
We set: $G = c = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} = 1$.

The curvature invariants of other black hole spacetimes can be deducted from the
Kerr-Newman ones by taking the apropriate limit of the black hole under consideration:

- Kerr spacetime: Kerr-Newman limit when $Q\rightarrow 0$  
- Reissner-Nordstr√∂m spacetime: Kerr-Newman limit when $a\rightarrow 0$  
- Schwarzschild spacetime: Kerr-Newman limit when $Q\rightarrow 0$ and $a\rightarrow 0$

The calculation is performed on `Matematica 13.0`, on AMD Ryzen 5 5625U and AMD ATI Barcelo. The order of magnitude of calculation time is the second.
