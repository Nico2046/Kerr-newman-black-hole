# Calculation of curvature invariants for Kerr-Newman spacetime

The goal is to calculate the curvature invariants associate to the Kerr-Newman metric. To do this we use the standard tensor calculus of general relativity.

The metric is written in Boyer-Lindquist coordinate system: (t,r,theta,phi). The following change of variable could be used to reduce calculation time: y=cos(theta).  
The metric signature used is $(+ - - -)$.
We set: $G = c = \frac{1}{4 pi epsilon} = 1$.

The curvature invariants of other black hole spacetimes can be deducted from the Kerr-Newman ones by taking the apropriate limit of the black hole under consideration:  

- Kerr spacetime: Kerr-Newman limit when Q -> 0
- Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m spacetime: Kerr-Newman limit when a -> 0
- Schwarzschild spacetime: Kerr-Newman limit when Q -> 0 and a -> 0
