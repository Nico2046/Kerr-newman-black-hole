# Calculation of curvature invariants for Kerr-Newman spacetime

The metric is written in Boyer-Lindquist coordinate system: (t,r,theta,phi). The following change of variable is made to reduce calculation time: y=cos(theta).  
The metric signature used is (+,-,-,-).  
We place ourselves in the natural unit system i.e: G = c = 1/(4*pi*epsilon) = 1.  
  
The calculation is performed on matematica 13.0, with:  

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5625U  
- GPU: AMD ATI Barcelo

The curvature invariants of other black hole spacetimes can be deducted from the Kerr-Newman ones by taking the apropriate limit of the black hole under consideration:  

- Kerr spacetime: Kerr-Newman limit when Q -> 0
- Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m spacetime: Kerr-Newman limit when a -> 0
- Schwarzschild spacetime: Kerr-Newman limit when Q -> 0 and a -> 0
